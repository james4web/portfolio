                <p class="limit-text-width">SiteBuilder is the internal Site Suilding tool at eBay. Think Squarespace or WIX. My responsibility was to push the product forward. I was responsible for designing and building out new components, and over time I created a redesign of the entire product, which I largly implemented myself. This required HTML, SCSS, and JS, as far as coding. 
                </p>
                <p class="limit-text-width">SiteBuilder was initially a $100 plugin with very limited functionality. A large part of pushing this product forward was addressing the limitations inherent in it. This included dramatic UI functionality changes in order to build more powerful components, and an overall redesign of the entire product to deal with the component proliferation. </p>
