                    <h5>The Problem</h5>
                    <p class="mb50">People have difficulty finding new and exciting travel destinations. Travelers must sift through mountains of subjective reviews, experiences & opinions. Which is very difficult to weave into cohesive guidance.</p>
                    <h5 style="padding-top: 0;">The Process</h5>    
                    <p class="mb50">This is some of the process work for the Travel App, 'Easy Road'. This project is trying to address the need for a high level decision making solution to help people discover new travel locations by leveraging user reviews from other travelers and collating and representing them in an easy to read format. The process included user interviews, infinity maps, cardsorting, competitve audit, paper prototypes, lofi and hifi wireframes, prototyping and user testing.</p>
