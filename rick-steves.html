                    <h5>The Task</h5>
                    <p>We rarely work alone when developing projects.Being able to work in a group is an important and neccessary skill. This project required that a direction be developed, firstly through a competitive audit, wireframing and then developing the design. This requires open, honest feedback, and compromise, in order to create a final product which best meets the projects needs.</p>
                    <p>In the lower right is my initial mock-up which was used during the design process. Once the homepage design was finished and the secondary pages needed to be created for the site, I built a ‘spec guide’ which would help maintain consistency between pages. It is shown in the lower left. This lists the typefaces, font sizes, margins, colors, spacing etc.</p>
