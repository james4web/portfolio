                    <h5>The App</h5>
                    <p>A vital aspect of creating an app or website is the planning phase. It helps to clarify concepts and understand the problem in the necessary detail.This shows some of my process work. This includes wireframes, mood-boards, persona’s, scenario’s, color palette and definition statements. Every app needs an icon. This icon uses a bright, gradated background, which mirrors the design themes within the app. The orange and yellow connote dynamism and activity, which speaks to the nature of the app. The circle has a number of meanings. Literally it relates to circuit training. Less literally, it connotes focus and effort.</p>
