                    <h5>The Task</h5>
                    <p>Newfi is a consumer facing mortgage and refinancing startup who’s current website is doing them no favors at all. They need a credible web presence if they are going to make it in this industry. Most if not all of their business comes directly through their website, so it is vital that it addresses the needs of the user, and represent the clients offerings as clearly as possible.</p>
                    <p class='mb50'>My job was to take all these existing issues into consideration, and redesign the homepage and the about page, and determine messaging. Other pages will be built out in the next phase. I was given approximately a 6 day timeframe to work in. This included research, wireframes for the client to review, and mock-ups also for review.</p>
                
                    <h5>The Solution</h5>
                    <p>We showed the client a number of websites from competitors in their space or businesses in closely related spaces, such as investment banking. They showed a preference for a bright and light color palette and aspirational messaging, over a sleek and dark design. The primary audience was identified as millennials.</p>
                    <p>I distilled the primary themes that represented newfi to the following. New technology, better rates, security, experience & transparency. The goal of the ‘why newfi’ page was to help the user become familiar and trust newfi. This is done through a detailed explanation of what newfi is about, followed by a testimonial providing social proof, and then team profiles, which help personalize the people who work at the company.</p>
                    <p>The pre-existing brand colors are blue and orange. Blue’s color meaning is connected with trust and security. For this reason I used blue as a primary accent color throughout, while orange is used as an action color. I utilized whitespace & typography, a clean visual hierarchy, & meaningful imagery to create a design devoid of unwanted visual noise, and with focussed and visually compelling messaging.</p>
                    <p class="mb50">Overall the redesign was successful in communicating newfi’s offerings, while dovetailing this with an over-arching aspirational theme that newfi's offerings will make your life better, and you will be happier. This is clearly communicated in the hero section; ‘Better rates, Better life’, showing a couple enjoying the money they saved on overseas travel.</p>
