                    <h5>The Task</h5>
                    <p>The current website is not stimulating inquiries and business as much as the vendor would like. Reasons for this are the UI is poorly designed, utilizing a very limited & dark color pallette, poor sectioning and messaging, & the site has some glaring deficiencies with regard to CRO such as their being no way to request a quote above the fold. They did not adequately represent & incorporate the themes of the ice cream business; bright colors, compelling images, and a sense of play.</p>
                    <p>I had 7 days to research, wireframe, mockup and develop the new Ben & Jerrys website which consisted of 20+ pages.</p>
                    <p class="mb50">More specifically what influences people, where do they get their information, and how do they prioritize that information when processing it.</p>
                    <h5>The Solution</h5>
                    <p>A central tenant of the B&J franchise business is catering. This is the dominant revenue stream. To increase business in this segment of their offerings, the hero image on the homepage prominently advertises its availability, and an orange button links to a quote form. Its availability is highlighted repeatedly throughout the site.</p>
                    <p>Another primary goal was to redesign the content from the ground up through typography, color and layout, and creating a far more visually engaging design which will make the user aware of what NJ/NY Ben & Jerry’s has to offer while staying true to the brand identity.</p>
                    <p>Numerous pages were created which were dedicated to specific types of catering; birthday, anniversary etc. This served a number of purposes: it created taylor made content based on the user’s needs, and it also improved the sites SEO performance and google rankings for catering, which in turn led to increased business.</p>
                    <p>As of writing, the website has been up approximately 4 months and their business is at an all time high. They had the busiest January they have ever had, and it was coming close to the summer month records. Overall, a very happy client.</p>
